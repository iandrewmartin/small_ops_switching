# small_ops_switching
Small Operations Layout Switchlist generator

This project started because I could not find a way to generate an operations switchlist for a small model railroad that I had designed back in 2017.

Developed in Microsoft Excel 2010, this should work in almost any version of the software.

Future directions are to get the spreadsheet to work in Google docs and Open Office/Libre as well.
